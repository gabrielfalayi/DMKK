Francis Zavier Ngannou.(born 5 September 1986)[13] is a Cameroonian and French[14] professional mixed martial artist and professional boxer who is currently signed to the Professional Fighters League (PFL).

He also competed in the Heavyweight division in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he was the reigning UFC Heavyweight Champion at the time of his departure from the promotion. Known for his punching power, Ngannou was widely viewed as the most destructive pure puncher in the UFC's heavyweight division.

He ended seven of his fourteen UFC fights by knockout before the two-minute mark in the first round. 

Ngannou was born and raised in the village of Batié, Cameroon.[17] He lived in poverty and had little formal education growing up.[18] Ngannou's parents divorced when he was six years old, and he was sent to live with his aunt. At 10 years old, Ngannou started working in a sand quarry in Batié because of a lack of funds.[19][20] As a youngster, he was approached by several gangs in his village to join them.[21] However, Ngannou refused and instead decided to use his father's negative reputation as a street fighter as motivation to do something positive and pursue boxing.
